    /*IF THIS IS THE FIRST FILE YOU COME ACROSS IN THIS PROJECT -
     *
     * Please take time to learn some Android basics before coming to this code. I had been developing
     * while learning, which is a hard enough task. Knowing Java is not enough to start modifying this
     * code. It will be a nightmare to figure this out without some basic knowledge of activities, fragments,
     * connecting to the network (Android volley), grade dependencies, and android manifest*/

    /*Recommendation: if starting from scratch or doing large overhaul, request ALL user information after login,
    * and not throughout runtime. If the app is going to crash from a network transaction, you may
    * as well know at the beginning and not mid-use. Organize all the information as you want it too*/


    /*Please note some code will look professionally written but is not used anywhere, namely a lot
    * of code with TODO: headers.
    * this code comes from default implementations when creating new classes in Android studio.
    * They can be used but I opted to not. It may be different for you. See tutorials on android fragments*/

    /*This class was created at the end of the project for documentation. If it causes problems in building,
    * exclude it from the build or delete it to get a clean run.*/

    /*If you do receive this code, a solid month or two of learning some of the below concepts before
    * even touching this code will make the process much easier if you want to build off this.*/

    /*I will make notes here as I document so that I can mention what else you should know about before starting:
    * this is list in no particular order. Sorry about that! A simply YouTube video per topic should be good
    * get some practice too
    *
    * -android contexts
    * -views (i.e. textviews, editText, listView, buttton)
    * -understand a little bit of JSON, or at least how its used in doing network stuff in software
    * -Google's GSON class (well-documented online) - learn this after understanding JSON but before
    * coding with JSON
    * -Google/android Volley class (ended a 2-month struggle for me regarding network communications
    * with our app
    * -Android Intents and starting Activities
    * -Android dialogs
    * -Java Type template (TypeToken class)
    * -Java SimpleDateFormats
    * -Android "Toast" and "Snackbar" messages
    * */

    /*If your URL for AWS or other server changes, read through the RecoveryAsAServiceNetworkTransaction class*/

    /*When final starting with this code, you should understand:
    * How is use the Gson() class
    * What RecoveryAsAServiceNetworkTransaction's job is */
